This React Native project displays a list of users fetched from a placeholder API. The app features a search bar for filtering users, a sorting option to organize the list by name or email, and dynamically generated profile pictures for each user using https://picsum.photos. The app is built using React Native components, react-native-paper, and react-navigation.
